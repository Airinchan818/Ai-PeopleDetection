A lightweight human detection model designed for real-time applications.
SMVIT is a hybrid approach, inspired by YOLO-style detection heads and DETRâ€™s transformer-based architecture.

- âš¡ Ultra-lightweight: model size only ~3MB

- ðŸŽ¯ Capable of detecting humans in various conditions (day, evening, or night)

- ðŸ’» Runs smoothly on CPU (even low-spec laptops)

- ðŸ”¬ Designed from scratch, not just YOLO/ResNet fine-tuning

with this project, you can run Ai by CLI : 
bash 
```
  python -m main
```
